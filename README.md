# Murder

Murders is a continuation work of <a href="https://github.com/ValdoMpinga/MurdersRPC">Murders RPC</a>  

> Status: Developed

# Work Context

The present work had as objective to develop the abilities of the students in the
integration of different services by writing APIs, importing data and integrating between
databases and other services.

# Work rules

+ For the development of the proposed works, the language of
Javascript programming with the Node.js framework.
+ The implementation details that are due to the interpretation of the statements by the
groups of students should be described in the slides with detail and justification of the options taken.
+ The implementation of extra functionalities not present in the statement will be valued, provided that
these features do not modify the mandatory requirements and do not reduce the difficulty of the
job. The extra functionalities implemented must be documented in the slides to be
deliver with work.
+ Submission of non-original reports and/or implementations that constitute plagiarism,
lead to the immediate attribution of a zero grade in the group work and to eventual processes
disciplinary.

# Work fullfiled goals description

 - [x]   Each group should use the same dataset used in Practical Assignment 1 ( <a href="https://github.com/ValdoMpinga/MurdersRPC">Murders RPC</a> ) and reuse the
structure already defined in the previous work.
 - [x]   At least 3 entities present in the TP1 dataset must be selected, and
at least 2 of these entities must have a membership relationship, that is, one of the entities
must have a 1-N or N-N relationship with the 2nd entity. Examples: Team / Player (one
Team has several players, one player is in only one team); Film / Actor (each actor
can participate in multiple Films and each Film has multiple actors).
The. If the dataset does not allow individualizing 3 entities, the group should discuss with the
teachers looking for alternatives.
 - [x]  A structure must be defined in a NoSQL database (MongoDB - www.mongodb.com)
where these entities will be represented. The database must have the necessary collections
to represent the defined entities.
